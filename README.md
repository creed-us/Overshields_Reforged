# Overshields Reforged

Overshields Reforged began as a fork of the [Overshields](https://github.com/enthh/overshields) addon by enthh, but turned into a rewrite.

Overshields Reforged adds information about shielding on Blizzard unit frames.

Works with Blizzard's default Player, Target, Focus, Party, and Raid frames.
